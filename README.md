# Lab.-of-Digital-Systems-Design

106.2【電子系】ET3804301 數位系統設計實習 Lab. of Digital Systems Design

## Overview
This repository contains HDL source code, simulation testbenches, and project files for a series of laboratory exercises in digital systems design using Intel (Altera) Quartus and ModelSim. Each lab/homework directory includes the Verilog modules, pin assignment files, and simulation setups required to build and verify designs on the DE2-115 FPGA board.

## Repository Structure
- `hw01/`, `hw02/`, `hw3/`, `lab4/`: Project folders for each assignment/lab
  - `*.v`: Verilog HDL source files
  - `*_tb.v`: Testbench sources for simulation
  - `*.qpf`, `*.qsf`, `*.qws`: Quartus project files and settings
  - `incremental_db/`, `db/`, `output_files/`, `simulation/`: Tool-generated or project-specific subdirectories
- `DE2_115_pin_assignments.csv`: Pin map reference for the DE2-115 board
- `README.md`: This document

## Prerequisites
- Quartus II / Intel Quartus Prime (version compatible with DE2-115 projects)
- ModelSim (Intel FPGA Edition recommended) for running simulations
- DE2-115 FPGA board (for hardware deployment)

## Getting Started
### Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuoyaoming/Lab.-of-Digital-Systems-Design.git
cd Lab.-of-Digital-Systems-Design
```

### Open in Quartus
1. Launch Quartus.
2. Open the desired project by selecting the corresponding `.qpf` file (e.g., `hw01/hw01.qpf`).
3. Review or update device and pin assignments as needed (`.qsf` and provided CSV).

### Build (Synthesis and Fitter)
1. In Quartus, set the active project to the target lab/homework.
2. Run Analysis & Synthesis.
3. Run Fitter (Place & Route).
4. Generate programming file (`.sof`).

### Program the FPGA
1. Connect the DE2-115 board via USB-Blaster.
2. Open Programmer in Quartus.
3. Select the generated `.sof` file from `output_files/`.
4. Click "Start" to program the device.

## Simulation with ModelSim
There are ready-to-use testbenches (e.g., `*_tb.v`). You can run simulations via Quartus-ModelSim integration or directly in ModelSim.

### Run in ModelSim (CLI example)
```bash
# From the project folder (e.g., hw01/)
vsim -do simulation/modelsim/simulate.do
```
If a `do` script is not available, compile sources manually in ModelSim:
```tcl
vlib work
vlog *.v
vsim -c work.hw01_tb -do "run -all; quit"
```
Adjust the top-level testbench target as needed (e.g., `hw02_tb`, `lab3_tb`).

## Notes
- Some subfolders such as `incremental_db/`, `db/`, and `output_files/` are tool-generated. They can be regenerated by Quartus and are kept here for convenience.
- PDFs named `實習題目-*.pdf` contain the original lab assignments/specifications.
